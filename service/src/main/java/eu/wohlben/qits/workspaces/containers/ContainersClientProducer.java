/**
 * The one {@link ContainersClient} this process has, and where its bearer comes from.
 *
 * <p><b>The jar brings no bean of its own, on purpose.</b> {@code ContainersClient} is a plain class
 * that takes its values in a constructor and depends on neither quarkus-arc nor any OIDC extension —
 * which is what lets a process with no CDI construct one with {@code new}, and what leaves this
 * decision here. The defaults ship at ordinal 100 in the client jar, so the lines below name keys
 * rather than values.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @Singleton}, so one {@code HttpClient} serves the process.</b> That object is what an
 * {@code HttpClient} is for, and it must not be static inside the jar: a static one is created at
 * image build time and native-image refuses the heap it lands in.
 *
 * <p><b>The token is asked for per request and it costs the header, never the call.</b> That is the
 * {@code TokenSource} contract: a source that throws is a source that returned nothing, so a broken
 * or unreachable qits-idp turns into a 401 from qits-containers — reportable, one of the four
 * answers — rather than an exception on the thread that asked for a workspace. Empty is the shipped
 * posture: {@code quarkus.oidc-client.qits.client-enabled} is {@code false} and the owner in the
 * path is trusted on network trust exactly as every sibling hop is today.
 *
 * <p><b>The wait is bounded, and that is this package's standing rule rather than a preference.</b>
 * Several callers are HTTP worker threads inside {@code WorkspaceService}'s {@code synchronized}
 * methods, so an untimed {@code await().indefinitely()} — which is what every {@code …AndAwait}
 * spelling hides — would park every workspace operation behind one slow token endpoint while holding
 * a monitor. {@link TokensHelper} is what makes it one fetch rather than one per call: it holds the
 * token until it expires and refreshes it in the background, so a restarted idp pauses new issuance
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Copied from qits-ci's producer of the same name, which is the platform's worked example of this
 * seam. It is a copy rather than a shared class for the reason every cross-repo double here is one:
 * the two services share no module, and the jar deliberately ships no bean.
